# Introduction
Data on the population currently incarcerated in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) as of December 2023. This data was acquired through the California Public Records Act (CPRA). As a result, several exclusionary criteria have been applied and limit visibility of the entire population. Some CDCR identification numbers are also hashed for de-identification throughout the dataset(s).
